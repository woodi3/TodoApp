# TodoApp
Here's the TodoApp that Minorities in Computing is building during the "Let's Code: Building Apps with JavaScript" series. The TodoApp project contains files for a NodeJS server and an Ionic 3 project folder.


* To the students who were following along on Feb. 20th at Part 1, to get your project up to date with this one, follow the steps below:

1. Download the zip file for the project

2. Copy the routes folder, models folder, server.js file, and the package.json file to your project directory.

3. In a terminal window, navigate to your project directory and run:
```
npm install
```

* You should now have any new modules.

* To get your ionic project up to date, just copy the CoolTodoApp folder (the entire folder) into your project directory.

* The server files have been commented to the best of my abilities, if you think otherwise, just message me with your questions. (server.js, routes/routes.js, models/todo.js)

* I have not commented the ionic project yet. Will do that after Thursday (Feb 22).

* If you don't plan on following along, you can read through the different files and read the comments.
